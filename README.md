# kukinterviewer

A telegram bot written in node based on `node-telegram-bot-api` that helps you prepare for an interview.

You can tell it questions to add, manage questions with tags, tell it to ask you a random question from enabled tags and questions, and a bit more. Bot does this when asked in human English.

The point is to simulate a process of being asked a random question on a topic, with options to answer with text, voice message, video message, a file, whatever you would like to see in your chat history.
