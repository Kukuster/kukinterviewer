# kukinterviewer

A Telegram messenger bot written in node based on `node-telegram-bot-api`. Helps you prepare for an interview.

Add a bot: [@kukinterviewerbot](https://t.me/kukinterviewerbot). Greet it.

You can tell it to add questions, manage tags in questions, tell it to ask you random questions regularly, set the time and frequency you want to be asked, disable any questions or tags so it won't ask them.

All communicated in chat in human English in the imperative form, a command per message.

<br>
The main idea is to simulate a process of spontaneously being asked a random question on a topic, with options to answer with text, voice message, video message, a file, whatever you would like to see in your fully editable chat history. <b><i>All adjustable right there in the chat with natural language requests.</i></b>
