# kukinterviewer

A [Telegram messenger](https://telegram.org/) bot written in node based on [`node-telegram-bot-api`](https://github.com/yagop/node-telegram-bot-api). Helps you prepare for an interview.

Add this guy: [@kukinterviewerbot](https://t.me/kukinterviewerbot). Greet it.

You can tell it to add questions to his list, tag questions, tell it to ask you random questions regularly, how often do you want to be asked and what time of day, and such.

All communicated in chat in human English in the imperative form, a command per message.

<br>
The main idea is to simulate a process of spontaneously being asked a random question on a topic, with options to answer with text, voice message, video message, a file, whatever you would like to see in your fully editable chat history. <b><i>All adjustable right there in the chat with natural language requests.</i></b>
