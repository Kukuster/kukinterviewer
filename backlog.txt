<Planned>

• change matchTrees.inverse test to works not for all the Commands, but only within States.

• delete the chat document for Kukuster, and make sure the Greet State and the Start Command work properly.

• make addQuestion work as a two-step Command as well (as message prompt).
«add new question»
 - «ok, write me a new question text now»
«what do you know about web?»

• make addQuestion support telegram markdown

• make stuff like, when:
 - deleting a lot of tags,
 - deleting a lot of questions,
 - adding/deleting a lot of tags to/from questions,
 - enabling/disabling all the questions/tags
user be asked by a bot "are you sure you want to ...?" before actually executing

• Add support for complex query logic for questionsQuery (and tagsQuery) 

• Implement automatic questions asking with node-cron functionality

• implement searchQuestions and searchTags (maybe just use .execute methods of listQuestions and listTags for them)

• With the new questionsQuery flag ('havingTagsEnabled'), add the following possibilities for the listQuestions matchTree:
    - lists all questions that are both enabled by question and by all of its tags:
        - «list questions that are fully enabled»
    - lists all questions that are disabled only by tags:
        - «list questions that are disabled by tags»
        - «list questions some of which tags are disabled»
        - «list questions that are enabled but disabled by tags»
        - «list enabled questions that are disabled by tags»
    - lists all questions that are disabled in any way (either by question or by its tags):
        - «list questions that won't be asked»
        - «list questions that I won't be asked»
        - «list questions that you are not going to ask me»
        - «list questions that are disabled either by tags or by question»

• When querying questions, make an option to specify several tags with logical "AND"
 E.g. 
 - «list questions that tagged both #tag1 and #tag2»
For this, I want to make questionsQuery support complex query logic
in a way that mongoDB aggregation works: $match, $and, $or operators.
So that it can be further extended to support such queries:
 - «list questions that are turned on and have either #tag1 and #tag2 or #tag4»
 - «list enabled questions that contain either both "backend" and "javascript" or "nodejs"»


• «show any question» should work


• Add data encryption for user data

• implement display methods for all Commands

• add "fallback" Command for each State.
The command's intent is to check if some of the key words that are used in other Commmnads in the State, and make the bot respond with something like:
<< Sorry, I don't get what do you want me to "tag". Try something simpler.
You can ask me to:
    add specific tags to specific questions by id
    remove specific tags from specific questions by id
    ...
    >>
or
<< Sorry, do you ask me to "delete" something or to "add" something? I don't get it. Try something simpler.
You can ask me to:
    add specific tags to specific questions by id
    remove specific tags from specific questions by id
    ...
    >>



<Optional>

• Tests
    - sheet methods
        - addTagsToQuestions
        - removeTagsFromQuestions
        - turnQuestionsOnOff
        - getTags
        - turnTagsOnOff
        - getQuestions (only additional questionsQuery Tags flags)


• Extend listTags Command functionality to support querying by qids

• Extend functionality of turnQuestionsOnOff tree, allowing more complex requests
E.g.:
 - «turn all #web questions off»
 - «enable all questions from tag #web»

• Add support for adding other (attached) objects to Question (images, voice, files)
This may require storing this data in the database and reuploading it to Telegram when asking a question

• questionsQuery: add support for specifying qid range
    E.g.:
    - «list questions 3-6»
    - «show me questions from 3 to 6»

• Add a "revert last action" command.
For this, i'll have to save data about last executed command in the database, including contents of Questions and etc. to be able to restore it after edition or deletion.

• optimize mongodb queries in sheet methods
    e.g.:
        deleteQuestions:
            ` db.chats.update({"chatId":231079996},{"$pull":{"Questions":{"qid": 34 }}}); `
            run this in mongo shell, and it will remove question #34 from that chat

• currently bot memorizes all tags as lowercase. Consider changing it to like they did with emails, i.e. case-insensitive, except it memorizes the case with the first time.
